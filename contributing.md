## How to Resolve an Issue

If you want to work on an open issue, follow this simple flow:

1. **Pick an issue**: Start with `good first issue` or `easy` labels if you are new.
2. **Comment on the issue**: Leave a short message like "I can work on this" to avoid duplicate work.
3. **Create a branch**: Use a clear branch name, for example `fix/workable-count-summary` or `docs/uv-quickstart`.
4. **Implement and test locally**:
   - `uv sync --frozen`
   - `uv run python -m scripts.generate_readme`
   - `uv run python -m scripts.generate_index`
   - (if needed) `uv run python -m scripts.fetch_workable_counts`
5. **Open a PR linked to the issue**:
   - Include `Closes #<issue-number>` (or `Fixes #<issue-number>`) in the PR description so GitHub closes the issue automatically after merge.
   - Add a short summary of what changed and how you tested it.
6. **Address review feedback**: Push follow-up commits to the same branch until approved.
